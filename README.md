# Flex-box-with-React-Native
React Native helps you build real native mobile apps faster, using the same React skills you’d use for web development — but running directly on iOS and Android.
React Native lets you write components using React syntax (like <View>, <Text>, and <Image>) that are actually translated into real native UI elements, not web views. So your app looks and feels like a real native app — fast and responsive.

Key things to know:

It uses JavaScript (or TypeScript) with React concepts like state, props, and components.

You can use native modules when you need deeper access to platform features (like camera, GPS, Bluetooth, etc.).

Styling is done with a Flexbox-like layout, similar to CSS, but tailored for mobile.

You can hot reload your code, meaning you see your changes instantly without rebuilding the app.
Here’s the quick breakdown:

Default:
flexDirection: 'column' → items go vertically.

If you want horizontal layout:
You set flexDirection: 'row' → items go side by side (left to right).
